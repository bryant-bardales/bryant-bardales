- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bryant-bardales

Full-stack developer and lifelong technology enthusiast, I am a current junior and Tech Talent Pipeline resident at Brooklyn College pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I recently graduated from LaGuardia Community College with an Associate of Science in Computer Science. I am highly motivated to continue learning and participate in any development projects. 

I was selected to become a resident in Brooklyn College's Tech Talent Pipeline Program through my hard work. In this residency, I received the opportunity to train in Javascript, HTML5, CSS, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Git, and GitHub through various group projects. 

I have also participated in Java, Python, and C++ projects for programs, including Google's CSSI: Online Program and LaGuardia's Tech Scholar Program.
