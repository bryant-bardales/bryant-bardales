- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bryant-bardales

I am future software engineer and lifelong technology enthusiast.

Recently graduated LaGuardia Community College with an AS in Computer Science and am a current junior at Brooklyn College in pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I am interested in software engineering and am seeking exciting opportunities related to the same.

I have participated and created projects in Java, Python, and C++ for programs including Google's CSSI: Online Program and LaGuardia's Tech Scholar Program.

I created and currently facilitate a program in collaboration with my old high school called "College Talk" where I connect with 11th and 12th grade students and speak to them regarding the importance of a college education.
