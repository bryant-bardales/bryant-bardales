- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bryant-bardales

I am full stack developer and lifelong technology enthusiast.

Current junior at Brooklyn College in pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and recent graduate of LaGuardia Community College with an Associate's of Science in Computer Science.

I am interested in software engineering and am seeking exciting opportunities related to the same.

I have participated and created projects in C++, Java, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React for programs including Google's CSSI: Online Program, LaGuardia's Tech Scholar Program, and Brooklyn College's Tech Talent Pipline Program. 

I created and currently facilitate a program in collaboration with my old high school called "College Talk" where I connect with 11th and 12th grade students and speak to them regarding the importance of a college education.
